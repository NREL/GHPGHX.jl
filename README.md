This repository contains an executable (shared object, compiled fortran code) file that contains ground heat exchanger (GHX) calculations for use in REopt when considering geothermal heat pumps (GHP).

This file is called by REopt when GHP is considered in a REopt evaluation. 

This repository and file is governed by a separate [license](https://github.com/NREL/GHX-Model-REopt/blob/main/LICENSE.md) which dictates that this GHX model should only be used in the context of REopt analysis, and it cannot be used for commercial purposes.

Instructions for cloning this repository's file into a user's local version of the REopt API for evaluating GHP is provided in the [REopt_API repository](https://github.com/NREL/REopt_API).
